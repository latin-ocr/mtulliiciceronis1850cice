A complete, thorough, practicae, and easy Greek course is here presented. The be-
ginner commences with the ‘² First Book‚'' in which the elementary principles of the lan-
guage are unfolded, not in abstract language‚ difficult both to comprehend and to re-
member, but as practically applied in sentences. Throughout the whole, the pupil sees
Just where he stands, and is taught to use and apply what he learns. His progress is,
therefore, as rapid as it is intelligent and pleasant. There is no unnecessary verbiage‚
nor is the pupil's attention diver-ted from what is really important by a mass of minor
details. It is the experienee ot teachers who nse this book, that with it a given amount
of Greek Grammar can be imparted to a pupil in a shorter time and with farless trouble
than with any other text-book.

The “First Book '³ may with advantage be followed by the “Introduction to Greek
Prose Composition.” The obiect of this work is to enable the student, as soon as he ean
decline and conjugate with tolerable faculty, to translate simple sentences aster given ex-
amples and with given words; the principles employed being those of imitation and very
frequent repetition. It is at once a Syntax. a Vocabulary‚ and an Exercise-book. The
“Second Part'' carries the subject further, unfolding the most complicated constructione„
..nd the nicest points of Latin Syntax. A Key is provided for the teacher's use.

The “ Reader‚'' besides extracts judiciously selected from the Greek classics‚ contains
valuable instructions ‘oo guide the learner in translating and construing‚ and a complete
exposition of the particles‚ their signification and government. It is a fitting sequel to
the earlier parts of the course, everywhere showing the hand of an acute critic, an ac*
eomplished scholar, and an experienced teacher.

From the Rev. DR. COLEMAN, Professor of Greek and Latin, Prineeton. N. J.

“I can, from the most satisfactory experience, bear testimony to the excellence of
your series of Text-Books for Schools. I am in the daily use of Arnold’s Latin and
Greek Exercises, and consider them decidedly superior to any other Elementary Worka
1· those languages.
