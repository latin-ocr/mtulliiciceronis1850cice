Greek Ollendorff 3 .

Being a Progressive Exhibition of the PrInciples Of the Greek Gram<
mar. By ASAHEL C. KENDRICK, Professor of the Greek Lan-

guage and Literature in the University of Rochester. 12mo,
371 pageS.
¹ The present work is what its title indicates, strictly an Ollendorff, and ainis to apply
the methods which have proved so successful in the acquisition of the modern languages

to the study of Ancient Greek, with such differences as the different genius of the

Greek, and the different purposes for which it is studied, suggest. It differs from the
modern Ollendorffs in containing Exereises for recipi-ocal translatio'm in confining them

within a smaller compass, and in a more methodioal exposition of the principles of lan·
guage.

The leading object of the author was to furnish a book which should serve as an in-
troduction to the study of Greek, and precede the use of any grammar. It will therefore
be found, although not claiming to embrace all the principles of the Grammar‚ yet eom-
plete in itseli} and will lead the pupil, by insensible gradations‚ from the simpler construc-
tions to those which are more complicated and difficult. The exceptions, and the more
idiomatic forms, it studiously avoids‚ aiming only to exhibit the regular and ordinary
usages of the language as the proper starting-point for the student's further researches.

In presentIng these, the author has aimcd to combine the strictest accuracy with the
utmost simplicity of statement. His work is therefore adapted to a younger class of
pupils than have usually engaged in the study of Greek, and will, it is hoped‚ win to the
acquisition of that 'noble tongue many in our academies and primary schools who hav·
been repelled by the less simple character of our ordinary text-books.

Exercises in Greek Composition.

Adapted to the First Book of Xenophon's Anabasis. By JAMES R,
BOISE, Professor of Greek in the University of Michigan.
12mo, 185 pageS.

These Exercises consist of easy sentences, similar to those in the Anabasi3‚ having
the same words and constructions, and are designed by frequent repetition to make tha
learner familiar with the language of Xenophon. Accordingly, the ehapters and sections
in both are made to correspond. No exereises ean be more improving than those in this
volume; obliging the student as they do, by analysis and synthesis, to master the con-
structions employed by one of the purest of Greek writers, and imbm'ng him with the
spirit of one of the greatest histor-iaus of all antiqnity.
