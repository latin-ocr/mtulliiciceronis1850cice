Harkness’s Elements of Latin Grammar.

This work is intended especially for those who do not contemplate
a collegiate course, but it may be successfully used in any school where,
for special reasons, a small grammar is deemed desirable. The beginner
needs to store his mind at the outset with the laws of the language in
such forms of statement as he can carry with him throughout his whole
course of study. The convenience and interest of the student in this
regard have been carefully consulted in the preparation of this manual.
All the paradigms, rules, and discussions, have been introduced in the
exact language of the author‘s Grammar, by which it may at any time
be supplemented. While, therefore, in many schools this work will be
found a sufficient Latin Grammar, it may be used in others, either as
preparatory to the larger Graminar, or in connection with it.

No separate references to this volume will ever be needed in editions
of Latin authors, as the numbering of the articles is the same as in the

larger Grammar.
