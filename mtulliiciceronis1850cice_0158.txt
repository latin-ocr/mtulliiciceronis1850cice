Aliquid secutos] that they lead something in view, and so were not
prompted by cruelty.

6. Quae habitura sit] Observe the diffcrence made by using the sub-
iunctive instead of habitura est in this clause. See Z. Gr. ἓ 558.

In quo si mihi esset obtemperatum] Cicero here refers to his fruitless
efforts to prevent civil war, by restoring harmony between Oaesar and
Pompey. The sentence contains only a side thought.

7. Cum . . . . tum] See 5, 5. Cowfayient] Observe this idiomatic
and frequent use os the future instead of the pres. subj. in intermediate rel-
ative clauses, which contain the enunciation of precepts and laws. Comp.

tone, as it were. A similar violation of the usual rules for the connection of

ab armis discedant. Z. Gr. ξ 512.

12. Cum in fllacedonia . . . . esset] The clause in brackets is rejected by
Zumpt, 011 1116 ground of the improbability that the son of Cato should have
been discharged by Popilius, and again, five years later, by AEmih'us Paullus,
