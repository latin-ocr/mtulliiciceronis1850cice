A Latin Grammar for Schools and CollegeS.
By A. HARKNESS, ΡΗ. 1)., Professor in Brown University.

 

ΤΟ explain the general plan of the work, the Publishers ask the atten-

tion of teachers to the following extracts from the Preface:

1. This volume is desig-ned to present a. systematic arrangement of the
great facts and laws of the Latin language3 to exhibit not only grammat-
ical forms and constructionS, but also those vital principles which under-
lie, control, and explain them.

2. Designed at once as a text-book for the class-mom, and a book of
reference in study, it aims to introduce the beginner easily and pleasantly
to the first principles of the language, and yet to make adequate provi-
sion for the wants of tho more advanced student. ”

3. By brevity and conciseness in the choice of phraseology and ccm‘
pactness in the arrangement of forms and topics, the author has endeav-
ored to compress within the limits of a convenient manual an amount of
carefully-seleoted grammatical facts, which would otherwise fill a much
larger volume.

4. He has, moreover, endeavored to present the whole subJect in the
light of modern scholarship. Without encumbering his pages with any
unnecessary discussions, he has aimed to eni-ich them with the praelicat

results of the recent labors in the field of philology.

5. syntax has received in every part special attention. An attempt
has been made to exhibit, as clearly as possible, that beautiful system of
laws which the genius of the language—that highest of all grammatical
authority—has created for itself.

6. Topics which require extended illustration are first presented in
their completeness in general outline, before the separate points are dis-
cussed in detail. Thus a single page often foreshadows all the leading
features of an extended discussion, imparting a completeness and vividness
to the impression of the learner, impossible under any other treatment.

’7. Special care has been taken to explain and illustrate with the requi-
site fulness all difficult and intricate subjects. The subjunctive Mood—
that severest trial of the teacher's patience—has been presented, it ῐδ
hoped‚ in a form at once simple and comprehensive.
