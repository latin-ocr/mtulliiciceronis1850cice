5. Hos cle philosophia libros] It is evident from the words: qui illis
se aequarunt, that Cicero has here in mind all his philosophical writing3‚
and not merely this work, de Officiis.

6. Ut idem elaboraret, sequereturque] E laborare means to labor with suc-
cess, Laborare‚ when used alone, implies a want of success, which signifi-

below, ἓ 4. Atque hoec, (irc.

4. Hcec quidem quaestio] instead of quoestio de hac re.

T radendis] Z. Gr. ξ 643. Respecting the present signification of this
