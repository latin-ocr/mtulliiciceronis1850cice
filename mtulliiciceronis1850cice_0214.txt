Arnold’s First Latin Book 3

Remodelled and Rewritten, and adapted to the Ollendorff Method of
Instruction. By ALBERT HARKNESS, A. M. 12m0, 302 pages.

 

 

Under the labors os the present author, the work of Amold has undergone radjeal
changes. It has been adapted to the Ollendorff improved method of instruction, and is
superior to the former work in its plan and all the details of instruction. While it pro-
ceeds in common with Amold on the principle of imitation and repetition, it pursucs
much more exactly and with a surer step the progressive method, and aims to make the
pupi] master of every individual subject before he proceeds to a new one, and of each
subject by itself before it is combined with others; so that he is brought gradually and
surely to understand the most difficult combinations of the language. An important
feature of this book is, that it carries along the Syntax pari passu with the Etymology,
so that the student Is not only all the while beeoming familiar with the forms of the lan-
guage, but is also learning to construet sentences and to understand the mutual relations
of their component parts.

Speeial care has been taken in the exercises to present such idioms and expressions
alone as are author-izcd by the best classic authors, so that the learner may acquire by
example as well as precept, a distinct idea of pure Latinity.

It has been a leading object with the author so to classify and arrange the various
topics as to simplify the subject, and, as faras possible, to remove the disheartening diffi-
culties too often encountcrcd at the outset 'm the study osan ancient language.

From W. E. TOLMAN‚ Iti-structor in Providence myli School.

“ I have used Arnolffls First Latin Book, remodelled and rewritten by Mr. Harkness‚
in my classes during the past year, and find it to be awork not so much remodehed and

rewritten as one enCz'reZgs new, both in its plan and in its adaptation to the wants of the
beginner in Latin.''

From WM. Russmn, Editor of tlte First Series of the Boston Journal of Education.

“The form which this work has taken under the skillsul hand of Mr. Η. is marked
throughout by a method purely elementary, perfectly simple, gradually progressive, and
rigorously exact. Pupils trained on such a manual cannot fail ofbecoming distinguished,
in their subsequent ωορκ-055, for precision and correctness of knowledge, and for rapid
advaneement in genuine scholarship.”

From Gnonen CAPnoN, Principia of Worcester quh School.

“1 have examincd the work with care, and am happy to say that Ι find it superior
to any similar work with which Ι arn acquainted. 1 shall recommend it to my next
elass.”

From J. R. B01sn, Professor of Ano-ient Lanquaqes in illichiqan Universiffy.

*⁶ I have examined your First Book in Latin, and am exceedingly pleased both with
the plan and execution. I shall not fail to uae my influence toward introducing it into
the classical sehools of this State.''
