The Works of Horace.

With English Notes, for the use of Schools and Colleges. By J. Ι.
LINGOLN, Professor of the Latin Language and Literature in

Brown University. 121110, 575 pageS.

The text of this edition is mainly that 01· Orelli, the most important readings 01· other
&titios being given in foot-notes. The volume is introduced with a biographical sketch
01 Horace and a critique on his writings‚ which enable the student to enter intelligently
on his work. Peculiar grammatica] constructions, as well as geographical and historica}
allusions‚ are explained in notes, which are just full enough to aid the pupil, to excite
him to gain a thorough understanding of the author, and awaken 111 him a taste sor philo-
logical studies, without taking all labor off 1115 hands. While the chief aim has been to
impart a clear idea 01· Latin Syntax as exhibited in the text, it has also been a cherished
object to take advantage of the means so variously and riehly furnished by Horace for
promoting the poetical taste and literary culture of the student.

From αη ανΐὶσῖε by Phor. 1311111, of the University of Heidelbergy, in 15]ιο Heidelber9
ᾼιιηαῖὸ· of Literutzwe.

“There are already several American editions of Horace. intended for the use 01
50110015; 01· 0110 01· these, which has passed through many editions, and has also been
widely circulated in England‚ mention has been formerly made in this jour-nai, but that
one we may not put upon an equality with the one now before 115, inasmuch as this has
taken a different stand-point„ which may serve as a sign 01· progress in this department
of study. The editor has, it is true, also intended his work sor the use 01· 50110015, and
has sought to adapt 11, 111 all its parts, to such a use; but 51111, without losing sight-of

this purpose, he has proceeded throughout with more independence. In the preparaae ’

tion 01· 1110 Νο105, the editor has faithfully observed the principles (laid down in his pref-.,
ace); the explanations 01· 1110 poet's words commend themselves by a compressed
brevity which limits itself 10 what is most essential7 and by a sharp precision of expres-
510ος and references to other passages 01· the poet, and also to grammars, dictionaria,
ete„ are not wanting.”

Saliust's <Iugurtha and Catiline.

With Notes and a Vocabulary. By NOBLE BUTLER and MINARD
STURGIS. 121110, 397 pages.

Τ110 editors have spent a vast amount of time and labor in correeting the text, by a
comparison of the most improved German and English editions. Itis believed that this
will be found superior to any edition hitherto published in this country. In accordance
with their chronological order, the “J ugurtha '³ precedes the “ Oatiline.” The Notes aro

eopious and tersely expressed; they display not only fine scholarship, but (what 15 '

quite as necessary in such a book) a practica] knowledge of the difficulties which the stu-
dent encounters in reading this author, and the aids that he requires. The Vocabulary
was prepared by the late WILLIAM H. G. Bou-mm. It will be found an able and faithful
performanoe.
