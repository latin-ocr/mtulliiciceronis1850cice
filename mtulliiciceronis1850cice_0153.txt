justitia and fortitudo.-—-Soeietas hominum, is human society at large; con-
junctio is more limited, and refers to attachments o. friends and relatives,
See 17, 5. B. ’

6. Ordo . . . . conservabimus] The virtue of temperantia remains to be
briefiy described. Cicero particularizes ordo, constantia, moderatio, because
there is no one word in Latin which exactly corresponds with the Greek
σωφροσύνη. In the first of these two sentences he repeats what is stated
with less prominence in the preceding sentence, Reliquis . . . . continetur
namely, that these virtues and the like (all belonging to the fourth in order)
have their sphere in that department of thinys to which (external) aetivity is
,ο be applied, in which respect they differ from sapientia, whose duties (in-
dayatio atque inventio veri) require mentis agitatio. The last sentence
brings out the practical duty of the fourth virtue (his rebus, quae tractantur
in vita, modum quendam et ordinem adhibere) and its aim, (honestatem et
decus conservare.) B.

Autem] Compare 4, 3.

On. VI. Having set forth and briefly defined the four subdivisions of the
morally good, (honestum,) he proceeds to discuss them severally at greater
length. The following section is devoted to sapientia, and particularly to
the laying down of practical rules in relation to it.

picius, when tribune under AEmilius Paullus, in the Macedonian war, pre-
dicted an eclipse of the moon that was to occur on the day on which a bat-
tle was to take place, and thus prevented the alarm which its unexpected
appearance would have occasioned among the soldierS. Compare Liv. 44,
