Cratippum] Cicero⁷s opinion of this master of the Peripatetic school -.·

may be learned from ἓ 3 of this section, from ΙΙΙ, 2, 2. and de Fm. I, 3
5· [ΞΜ Athenis] Z. Gr. ξ 699. The case of this pronoun may be learned ἶ

from the nature of the clause which it represents. An illustra-tion of the ‘

principle may be derived from the examples from Euripides, cited in

Orosby’s Gr· Gr, ἓ 334, Ἑλένην κτάνωμεν, Μενέλεῳ λύπην πικράν. Here λύπην ’
is in the accusative case, because the clause to which it refers contains a 2
transitive verb and its object. The writer, having one and. the same thing .

in his mind all the time, gives the same form to his thoughts in both clauses.
Let us stay Helen, [let us cause] a buter grief to ,Menelaus In the other
example the nominative case is used. Στὲφη μιαίνεται, θεῶν ἀτιμία, our yar-
lands are presented, [which is] a dishonor to tlte yodS.

Proeceptis institutisque] principles and practical rules. The former

word refers to theoretical philosophy—the latter, to the practical rules of t

life.

In utriusque orationis facultate] that you may have equal facility in ·

both styles of discourse, namely, the oratorical and the philosophical. That
such is the meaning of these words would appear from the next sentence,
which can scarcely be interpreted satisfactorily if the author be supposed
to refer to the Greek and Latin languages in the words utriusque orationis.
The meaning of the sentence seems to be substantially this: As Ι have
found it advantageous in philosophy and oratory, to give my attention to
Greek as well as Latin studies, Ι advise you to do the same, that you may
have equal readiness as an orator and a philosopher.

The proper correlative of ut would be ita. Instead of it we find idem,
which, according to Gerulum-cl, refers not to ut but id. May not this be
considered a slight additional reason for the interpretation of utriusque ora-
tionis which is given in this note? G. B.

2. Ut videmur] Z. Gr. ξ 380.

Docti] Cicero called those indocti who were unacquainted with Greek
literature. See Acad. Quaest. Ι, 2.

Aliquantum] Z. Gr. §488

Et ad dicendam et adjudicandum] for their aid not only as orators, but
also as philosophers.

3. Disce-s tu quidem . . . . et disces] For similar repetition for the sake oi
emphasis, see 25, 10„ 27, 7. The future is here a softened imperative..
Z. Gr. ἓ 586. Tu quidem. Z. Gr. ἓ 27 8.

Utrique] that is, both the sects, (the N ew Academy and the Peripatetics‚) -

to one of which Cicero, to the other Cratippus, belonged. Z. Gr. ξ 141.
Impedio] Observe that the singular number is used, notwithstanding
