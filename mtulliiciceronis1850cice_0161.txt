ΠΒ. Ι. cAP. XVI. 145

Oa. XV. 1. Sed cum iis . . . . virtutis] The construction is: in quibus
si sunt simulacra, (irc. Compare similar construction, 13, 9. Modestia,
,emperantia . . . . justitia] Comp. 2, 9.

2. Illae virtutes . . . . attinqere] Comp. 6, 1. Atque ltaec in moribus]
scil. consideranda sunt. It is to be observed, that in this chapter and the
beginning of the next, Cicero lays down five rules which should govern us
in the practice of beneficence: first, (ἓὲ 1, 2,) that we should have regard
to the character, and in that should prefer the mild to the heroic virtues;
(2) (ἓ 3,) that we should have regard to the person's love toward us; (3)
(ξὲ 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,) to his favors to us3 (4) (ἓξ 10, 11,) to his necessities;
(5) (ch. XVI, ξ 1,) that regard must be had to the nearness of our connec-
tion with the person. This last rule he expands by setting forth the degree
of our relationship, (1) to mankind in general, in remainder of this chapter;
(2) to our countrymen, (ch. XVII, ἓξ 1, 2 ;) (3) to our relations, (ξ 3—§ 6 ;)
(4) to our friends, (ἓ ’7-Χὲ 10 ;) (5) to the state, (ἓ 11 to end os ehap.) Of
these three Chapters, the caption, so to speak, is found in XIV, 10. See
Conspectus and Garve's Amnerkmigen.

3. Diliyamur] Z. Gr. ἓ 555.

5. Utenda] Z. Gr. ἓ 657. Quodsi ea . . . . debemus] The meaning os
this sentence is as follows : If when you have borrowed you ought to return
more than you have received, what should we do when we have received
an unasked favor. An imitari] This is really the second part of a dou-
ble question. Compare the remarks of Zumpt in his Gr. ἓ 353.

9. Multa] is the object offaeiunt. Vel morbo in omnes] These words
are wanting in one of the best MSS. Heusinger, Beier, and Orelli read
modo instead of morbo, connecting it with judicic, to which Zumpt ob·
jects on account of the word vel, referring for his reasons to his Gram-
mar,§ 336.

10. Quod contra fit] co ntra, contrariwise. Beier, however, con-
siders quod the object of contra, a case of anastrophe. See Hand‘s

Turs. s. v. ΙΙΙ, 1.

4. Ferarum, in quibas inesse fortitudinem dicimus] Cicero has a higher
regard for the milder virtues. Comp. 15, 2.

5. Ac latissime quidem . . . . societas hcec est] Societas kaec, sc. universi
‚qencris humani, as he has called it above, ἓ 3. ¹ Hominibus and omnibu-ff
are datives of the possessor after est. Ut . . . . teneantur] so that. Ut
constitutum sit] αε. Observe t-he difference between the effect of the sub-
iunctive in ut constitutum sit, and of the indicative in ut in proverbio est.
Ε quihus ipsis] sc. legibus .· e= according] t0.—Cetera, i. e. all things not

included in the laws.
