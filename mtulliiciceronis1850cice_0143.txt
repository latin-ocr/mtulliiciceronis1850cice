Annum jam audientem] Cicero sent his son to Athens about the first
of April, B. O. 45, as we learn from a letter written by him to Atticus the
next year, (Ep. ad Atticum XV. 15‚) in which, speaking of his son, he says:
scripsit, sibi, post Kal. April—sic em'm annum tempus confici—nihil da-
tum esse. As he says in the text that his son has been hearing Cratippus
‚a year, it is inferred that Cicero began this treatise in the spring, or early
in the summer 44 B. O„ two or three months at most after the assassina·
tion of Oaesar.

On the other hand, the following reasons may be given sor believing that
the treatise was not commenced till the autumn of the same year: 1. In
the very frequent letters of this period, which give us almost the daily oc-
cupations of Cicero, there 15 110 mention of a work de Officiis till Oct. 24,
(Ep. ad Att. XV. 13.) 2. Cicero implies (de Off. ΙΙΙ. 33) that this book
⁷ was intended as a substitute sor the instruction which he had designcd
giving 1115 5011 111 person at Athens. It may be supposed, therefore, that it
was written after the project of visiting Greece was abandoned. He 111-
forms us (Ep. ad Att. XVI. Ἴ) that having set out on the voyage, he was
driven back to the vieinity of Rhegium on the sixth of August, and was
induced to give up his visit to 1115 son, and return to Rome, by the repre
sentations of his friends that a favorable change in public affairs had taken
place, and that his presence was demanded. He reached the capital the
last day 01' August, and having, on the second of September, delivered 1115
first Philippic, retired soon after to his country-seat Puteolanum. Here he
spent the months of October and November, and is supposed to have em-
ployed himself in writing this work. It is agreed that it was finished be-
fore the ninth of December.

A. W. Zumpt suggests that the disagreement here set forth may be
reconciled by supposing that the young Cicero, although he left homcthe
first of April, did not sor some time actually commenee 1115 attendance
