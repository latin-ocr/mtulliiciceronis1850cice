SEUOND BOOK.

Cu. Ι. See Conspectus.

1. Ducerentur] The English idiom would prefer the present tensa
comp. Madvig, ἓ 383.

2. Vitoe cultum] The dut-ies which have an influence to promote oux „

wolfare in respect to external things. B. Heusinger says of the phrase:
this is a description of the utility which is the subject of the book. Fa·
cultatem] Compare Ι, 3, 7. Zumpt, in a note on the passage under <on-
sideration‚ translates facultatem, possession ancl use. Cicero himself (de
Invent. Ι, 27, end) defines this word thus: Facultates sunt, aut quibus sa-
cilius fit, aut sine quibus aliquid confici non potest. B. This would be a
definition of the English word means. Opes] power, influenee. Opes
has in view the facility of accomplishing what you wish through others. Z.
Copice] wealtli. In quo . . . . utile] refers to ut Iioec . . . . persequar.
B. Tum quceri, etc] Tum properly belongs to the next clause, thus:
tum quid utile. Dixi] See I, 3, 7, and 9. De instituto] i. e. cur ad
hoc nos studium potissimum contulerimus. Beier. De judicio meo] i. e.
de nostra sententia ; de philosophia nobis potissimum probata. Beier.

3. Bonis viris] Zumpt thinks that these words express a little irony,
but Bonnell objects to that interpretation. It is well known that philoso-
phy had to struggle for admission to Rome; that, so late as the middle oi
the second century before the Christian era, Carneades, Diogenes, and Cri-
tolaus were, by a decree of the senate, driven out of the city, because they
taught the Greek philosophy there. See Aul. Gellius, Noct. Att. XV, 11
’ The prejudice against such studies gradually gave way, but had not eu-
tirely disappeared in the times of Cicero.

5. Nec rursum] nor on tlte other leand.

7. Actiones] public speeelzes, pleadingys, in the next sentence called litte·
τω forenses et senatoriae. ’

The tense of the subjunctive is in this sentence affected by the preceding
perfect infinitive, assecuti. Comp. Β.

3. Nec quicquam . . . . praeter, etc.] Proeter is thus found in the place
of nisi after a negative. Neue Jahr. Bd 55, S. 289.

5. Sive ratio constantiae virtutisque ducitur] Rationem alicujus ‹lm-ere
nihil aliud est quam rationem habere, id non negligere, ei consulere. Heu-
singer. Constantia = moral consistency.—-Ars] For this word Cicero
substitutes disciplina and discendi yenus in ἓ 7.
