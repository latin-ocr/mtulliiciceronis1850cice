PREFAOE. vfi

not thus referred, there are two classes, First, those which are com-
mon to several different editions and are uncredited in all, and may
therefore be considered common property3 second, those which have
been added by the American editor. Most of the derived noteS, besides
being translated, have been very much changed in their form, by being
abridged, condensed, and otherwise modified3 and in some cases so
much so, that it seemed hardly fair to impute the note in its new shape
to its real author. Some comments‚ therefore, will appear to be claim·
ed for this edition as original, which, by suggestion at least, are due to
another. But it will be very easy for any one, who has the authors
enumerated in the beginning of this preface, to see for himself to what
extent the notes are derived from others. A slight comparison will
show that the present editor has had little to do, but to use his judg-
ment, in selecting from the abundant materials furnished by able schol-
ars, and in preparing what he should select for American students.
No part of the writings of Cicero has been more fortunate than the
De Officiis in respect to the preservation and persecting of its text, nor
will it suffer in comparison with any in regard to the ability with which
its text has been illustrated and explained. If the book,now, not with-
out diffidence, presented to the public, shall have contributed any thing
to make the valuable labors of others more extensively available, its
object will have been accomplished. It has been prepared in the midst
of other duties, and retarded in its preparation by the repeated and pro-
tracted illness of its editor, and might put in a plea for the indulgence
which it will doubtless need. ’

In the first chapter of the second book, Cicero expresses the appre-
hension, that some good men may find fault with his devotion to philos· ·
ophy. He vindicates himself, however, by saying that he can no
longer benefit the commonwealth by his care and counsels, inasmuch
as it is now under the tyrannical control of one man. He must(
therefore, give -his activity a new direction. To yield to patriotic grief,
'in view of the sad change in the state, would soon exhaust and pros-
trate him. To give himself up to pleasures, at such an emergency,
would be unworthy of a man of his cultivation. He turns, thereforet
to philosophy for relies. It had been a favorite study of his youth, and⁴⁸
in the midst of active life, he had devoted to it what time he could gain>
from professional and political duties. Nor does he turn to philosophy
for relies merely. He is still influenced by patriotic motives3 for he
has in view the reputation of Rome and the elevation of his country-
men.
