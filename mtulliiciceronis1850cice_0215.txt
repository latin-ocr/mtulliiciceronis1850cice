ἶ· Second Latin Book.

Comprising an Historical Latin Reader, with Notes and Rules foi·
Translating‚ and an Exercise Book, developing a Complete Ana-
lytical Syntax, in a series of Lessons and Exercises, involving
the Coiistruction, Anaiysis, and Reconstruction of Latin Sen-
tenceS. By ALBERT HARKNESS, A.M., Senior Master in the
Providence High School. 12mo, 362 pageS.

 

This work is designed 35 a sequel to the author's ‘⁴ First Latin Book.” It comprisen
a complete analytical syntax, exhibiting the essential structure of the Latin language,
from its simplest to its most expanded and elaborate form.

The arrangement of the 10550115 15 decidedly philosophical, gradually progressive,
and in strict accordance with the law 01 development 01 the human mind. Every new
principle is stated in simple, clear, and accurate language, and illustrated by examples
cai-efully selected from the reading lessons, which the student is required to translate,
analyze, and reconstruct. He is also exercised in forming new Latin sentences on given
modcls. This, while it gives variety and interest to what would otherwise be iii the
highest degree monotonous, completely fixes in the mind the subject 01 the lesson‚ both
by analysis and synthesis.

The careiul study 01 this volume, on the plan recommended by the author, will
greatly facilitate tlie pupil's progr-ess in the higher departments 01 the language‚ Such
is the testimony 01 the numerous institutions in which Harkness's improved edition
01 Arnold has been introduced.

“The present volume appears to me to carry out excellently the system on which
the late lainented Arnold based his educational works; and in the Selections for Read·
ing, the Notes and Rules for Translating, the Exercises 111 Translating into Latin, the
Analyses, etc., Ι think it admirably adapted to advance tlie diligent student, not only
rapidly, but soundly, in an acquaintance with the Latin language.⁷'

From Pssor. GAEuMELL, ofBrown Uniwreity.

‘⁵ The book seems to me, as I anticipated it would be, 3 valuable addition to the works
now in use among teachers 01 Latin in the schools of the United States, and for many
of them it will undoubtedly form an advantageous substitute.''

From Pnor. 1111100111, of Brown Wziversity.
“It seems to me to carry on most successfully the method pursued in the First

Book. Thou‘gh 111-1οᾔ11 is very comprehensive, and combines judicious and skilfully-
formed exercises with systematic instruction.”

“This Second Latin Book gives abundant evidence 01 the author's learning and
tact to arrange, simplify, and make accessible to the youthsul mind the great and funda-
mental principles 01 the Latin lang-uage. The book 15 worthy 01 3 place in evei-y
emmeal school, and I trust will have an extensive sale-'¹
