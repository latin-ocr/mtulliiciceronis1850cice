Germania and Agricola of Caius Cornelius

Tacitus :

With Notes for Colleges. By W. S. TYLER, Professor of the Greek
and Latin Languages in Amherst College. 121110, 193 pages.

Tacitus's account of Germany and life of Agricola are among the most fascinating
and instructive Latin classica, The present edition has been prepared expressly for
college classes, by one who knows what they need. In it will be found: 1. A Latin
text, approved by all the more recent editors. 2. A copious illustration of the gram·
matieal constructions, as well as os the rhetorical and poetical usages peculiar to Taci-
tus. In a writer so concise it has been dcemed necessary to pay particular regard to
the connection of thought, and to the particles as the hingcs of that connection. 3.
Constant comparisons of the writer with the authors of the Augustan age, for the pur-
pose of indicating the changes which had already been wrought in the lang-uage of the
Roman people. 4. An embodiment in small compass of the most valuable labors of such
recent German critics as Grimm, Giinther, Grubcr, Kiessling, Dronkc, Roth, Ruperti,
and Walther.

From Pssor. meoLN, of Broum Universitgs.

‘⁶ Ι have found the book in d'aily use with my class of very great service, very practi-
081, and well suited to the wants of students. Ι am very much pleased with the Lifo
of Tacitus and the Introduction, and indeed with the literar-y character of the book
throughout. We shall make the book a part of our Latin course.''

The History of Tacitus :

By W. S. TYLER. With Notes for Colleges. 121110, 453 pages.

The text of Tacitus is here presented in a form as correct as a comparison of the best
editions can make it„ N otes are appended for the student's use, which contain not only

the grammatical, but likewise all the geographical, archaeological, and historical illustra· ⁴

tions that are necessary to render the author intelligible. It has been the constant aim
of the editor to carry studente beyond the dry details of grammar and lexicography,
and introduce them to a familiar acquaintance and lively sympathy with the author and
his times. Indexes to the notes, and to the names of persons and places, render refer
once easy.

From Paor. HACKETT, qf Neu-ton Theo-lomene Seminary.

“The notes appear to me to be even more neat and elegant than those on the ‘Ger‘
mania and Agricola? They come as near to such notes as I would be glad to write my-
oelf 011 a classic, as almost any thing that Ι have yet seen.”
