to the rules just laid down3 Bonnell would interpret his, as referring to tha
preceding quoe, dcc.
9. Aa illum finem] to that lima.

Cn. XVII. 2. Manisque cum multis . . . . contractae] and many Ιεαυε
with many, enyayements of business and commerce. Z.

5. Fratrum] Fratres in Latin, like ἀδελφοί 111 Greek, may include both
sexes. See Freund, s. v. Post consobrinorum, dte] consobrini is not 11616
6011611611 111 115 signification to the children of 5151615, but extends to those

9. copulatius] Zumpt is inclined to give this word an act. 16 significa-
tion. ‘⁶ Quod conjunctum est in eo sine dubio inest etiam ahquid quod con-
j ungat.'’ Ut ceque quisque altero delectetur, ac 86 ipso] that each. is as much

vita and victus, compare the remarks of Habicht, quoted by Doderlein‚
(Synon. IV. p. 448 ς) “ Vita and victua if they stand together, are so dis-
tinguished from each other, that the former denotes the public, the latter
the private life of the man? Viyent] Viyere differs from vivere, in de·
noting not mere life as the opposite of death, but life in its activity. V went,

Cn. XVIII. 1—2‚ 3-5. See Conspectus. Quid cuique . . . . necesse sit]
Bonnell supplies tribui from the preceding clause, making quid its subject,
and cuique 115 remote object. He maintains that necesse differs from neces—
sarius in always belonging to a predicate, and in always having some vei-bal
connection as above. Thus, in the following sentence from Seneca: emas,
non quod opus est, sed quod neccsse est, sc. emi.

2. Necessitudinum yradas] tlte dearces of relationslcip‚ as they are given

esse, qui est totus aptus ea: 8686. Z. With this sentence ends the discussion
of the second of the cardinal virtues, into which honestum is divided. Isbr
attalo is the next in order. 866 5, 2.
