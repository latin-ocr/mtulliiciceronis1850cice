Short and Comprehensive Greek Grammar.
By J. T. CHAMPLIN, Professor of Greek and Latin in KVaterville

College. mmo, 208 pages,

In compiling this Grammar, Professor Champlin has drawn upon thc best crities and
gmmmarians, and with the results of his research has interwoven much original matter
suggested during several years' experience in teaching‚ and editing Greek authors. His
design is to exhibit the essential facts and principles of the language in the clearest‚ brief-
est, and most practicable form possible. With this viem all theories and complicatione
belonging to general grammar have been avoided, and only their results used. The am-
plification and illustration of principles have been carried only so far as is necessary to
their comprehension. In this way all the real wants of the Greek student are met„ while
his attention is not distracted by unnecessary and embarrassing details. Materials sor

oral exereises arc supplied, and a sketch of Greek versification is given in an appendix

From the Rev. Mn. ANnnRsoN, Iv'ew Orleans.

“I believe the author has fully accomplished what he proposes in his presace. To
those wishing to study Greek, I am satisfied he has presented a book which will much
tend to simplify the study to beginners3 and at the same time, without being too volu-
minous‚ presents as lucid and full an exposition of the principles of the language as can
be contained within so small a compass.”

Kiihner's is universally acknowledged to be the most accurate, comprehensive, clear,
and practical grammar of the Greek language now extant. It is the work osone who de-

voted his life to Greek phssology, and spent years os patient labor in persecting this work. ν

Too full and learned sor the beginner‚ it is just what is needed for the college curriculum,
containing all that a book of reference should contain. The student will never appeal to
its pages in vain. In fulness of illustration‚ copiousness of reference, and philosophical
analysis of the various forms of language, it is unsurpaaeed, we might say unequalled. 0
The present translation is made by two distinguished American scholarii, who have
revised the whole, verified the references, and appended an original treatise of their own
on Greek versification. As now presented to the public, it is believed to be as perfect
n grammar of the Greek language as enlightened reeearch and profound scholarship cun

produce.
