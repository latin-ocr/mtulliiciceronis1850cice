Xenophon's Anabasis :

With Explanatory Notes sor the use of Schools and Colleges in the
United States. By JAMES R. BOISE, Professor of Greek in
the University of Miehigan. 121110, 393 pageS.

A handsome and convenient edition of this great classic, really adapted to the wants
of schools, has long been needed; the want is here met by Prof. Boise in a manner that
leaves nothing to be desired. Decidedly the best German edItions, whether text or com-
mentary be considered, have appeared within the last few years3 and of these Mr. Boise
has made free use; while, at the same time, he has not lost sight of the fact that the
classical 50110015 of this country are behind those of Germany, and that simplet and more
elementary explanations are therefore often necessary in a work prepared sor American
schools. Nothing has been put in the notes sor the sake of a mere display of learning—-
pedantry is out of place in a school-book3 and nothing has been introduced by way of
comment except what can be turned to practical use by the reader.

An historieal Introduction, which will enable the pupi] to enter on his task intelli·
gently, is prefixed. An abundance of geographical information, embodying the latest
discoveries of travellers, is supplied; and the whole is illustrated with Kicpert's excellent

map, showing the entire route of the ten thousand on their retreat.

The First Three Books of Anabasis:

With Explanatory Notes and References to Hadley and Kiihner's
Greek Grammars, and to Goodwin’s Greek Moods and Tenscs
A copious Greek-English Vocabulary, and Kiepert's Map of the
Route of the Ten Thousand. 121110, 268 pageS.

Xenophon⁷s Memorabilia of Socrates:

With Notes and an Introduction. By R. D. C. ROBBINS, Professor
of Languages in Middlebury College, Vermont. 121110, 421 pages.

This will be found an exceedingly useful book for College classes. The text is large
and distinct, the typography accurate, and the notes Judicious and scholar-ly. Instead
>f referring the student to a variety of bookS, few of which are within his reaeh, the edi-
tor has wisely supplied whatever is necessary. An admirable treatise on the Life of
Socrates introduces the work, and English and Greek Indexes render it easy to refer to
the text andmotes.
