Cn. VI. 1. Erqo umam ..... propositum, ut] Bonnell says that this is
not the statement of an abstract proposition, but of iife's problem for all,
and for that reason we have ut with the subjunctive instead of the accusa-
tive and infinitive‚ just as in the next ἓ we have prce-scribit, ut ; and in ἓ 9,
ut violem.

2. Omnium utilitatem esse communem] we are all tutet-ested in the 9⁰⁰³
of all.

3. Verum autem . . . . extremum] As Bonnell remarks, the conclusion
might have been dedueed immediately from the first proposition, ἓ 2: si
hoe natura praeseribit, ete.

7. Quae vacent injustitia] Comp. Ι, ’7, 2 , ΙΙΙ, 19, 4. B.

8. Hoec . . . . virtus] scil. justitia, which is easily supplied from the pre-
ceding sentence3 as Zumpt says: e vacatione injustitioe cogitatur justitia.
It should be remarked, however, that Orelli and Bonnell have quae non
vacent justitia, instead of the reading of Heusinger and Zumpt. The text
is very doubtful. Heusinger says: Quid Cicero velit, apparet; quid serip-
serit incertum est.

10. Phalarim] See H, 7, 16.

11. Ab homine . . . . detraxeris] We have in this section detrahere with
ab; with de, ἓξ 12, 14; with the dative, ἓξ 4, 7. B. It will be readily
observed that important clauses of this sentence are utilitatis tuce causa,
and ob eam causam.

13. Aut quid ejusmodi] Quid instead of aliquid. Z. Gr. 5708.
Derelictio] Bonnell says that this is the only place where this word is
found.

14. De se bene etei-stimans seseque diliyens] out of sels-esteem and sels-
love. Compare 33, 12 z scientiam suppeditantem voluptates, depellentem
dolores. Observe how the doctrine of this ξ is also qualified by ἓ 11.
Comp. B.

15. Ita semper, etc.] In this way, that is, by always adhering to the
principles here suggested, Ite will disclzarye lits deity.

16. Et potius] After a negative, the copulative conjunctions may have
an adversative force. Comp. atque after neque 111 this same sentence.

19. Eae tempore] According] to circumstances. See 4, 11.

 

Cu. VII. The foregoing chapters are in form introductory, and yet they
contain the essence of Cicero's ideas on the subject of this book. That

which follows seems to consist of repetitions and illustrations of those ideaS.
Garve. ⁸

1 Aliqui casus] Z. Gr. ἓ 135.

2. Ea: superioribus . . . . possit] In order to explain εκ, most commen-
tators give sunt the meaning of extant. Bonnell, however, prefers to con-
sidet it an enallage, by which the ex, which properly belongs to quibu:
perspici possit, is anticipated and connected with superioribus libris.
