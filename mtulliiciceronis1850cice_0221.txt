Lincoln's Livy.
Selections from the first Five Books, together with the Twenty-First
and Twenty-Second Books entirc; with a Plau of Rome, a Map
of the passage of Hannibal, and English Notes for the use of

Schools. By J. L. LINCOLN, Professor of the Latin Language

and Literature in Brown University. mmo, 329 pages.

The publishers believe that in this edition of Livy a want is supplied which has been
universally felt3 there being previous to this no American edition furnished with the re-
quisite aids for the successful study of this Latin author. The text is chiefly that of AJ-
schcfski, which is now generally received by the best critics. The notes have been pre-
* pared with special reference to the grammatical study of the language, and the illustration
of its forms. constructions‚ and idionis, as used by Livy. They will not be found to foster
habits of dependence in the student, by supplying indiscriminate translation or unneces-
sary assistance; but come to his help only in such parts as it is fair to suppose he can-
not master by his own exertions. They also embrace all necessary information relating
to history, geography‚ and antiquities.

Lincoln's Livy has been highly commended by ciitics, and is used in nearly all tho
colleges in the country.

From Pnor. Armimsox, of Watervz'lle Colleqe.

“A careful examination of several portions of your work has convinced me that, for
the use of students, it is altogether superior to any edition of Livy with which I am ae-
quainted. Among its excellences you will permit me to name the close attention given
to particles‚ to the subjunctive moed, the constant reference to the grammar& the dis-
crimination of words nearly synonymous, and the care in giving the localities mentioned
in the text. The book will be hereafter used in our college.”

Beza⁷s Latin Version of the New Testa-

ment.
12m0, 291 peges

The now-aeknowledged propriety of giving students os languages familiar works sor
«translation—thus adopting in the schools the mode by which the child first learns to talk
——has induced the publication of this new American edition of Beza's Latin Version os
the New Testament. Ever since its first appearance, this work has kept its place in the
general esteem3 while more recent versions have been so strongly tinged with the pecu-
liar views os the translators as to make them acceptable to particular classes only. The
editor has exerted himself to render the present edition worthy of pati-onage by its su-
perior accuracy and neatness3 and the publishcrs flatter themselves that the pains bo·
stowed will Insure sor it a preference over other edItions.
