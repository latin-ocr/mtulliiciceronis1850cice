2. M. Crassus] Pliny (H. N. 33, 10) says of Crassus: In agris suis ses·
tertium M M possedit, = 200‚000,000 sesterces in real estate‚= 5o,000,000
denarii. If his income from this was only six per cent„ (which was only

half the usual rate of interest for money at that period,) it yielded him ,

3,000,000 denarii yearly, equal to about 462‚000 dollars of our money.

If we reckon the pay of a common soldier at ten denarii a mouth, as it
was before Julius Caesar raised it, and the number of soldiers in a legion at
6300, the eost of maintaining one legion a mouth is 60,000 denarii, or an
rtrmy of four legions a year, 2‚880‚000 denarii, equal to 443‚ooo dollars,
which is less than the income estimated above. But the maintenanee of
an army occasioned other expenses besides the pay of the legionary
soldiers. The equites and the superior and inferior officers must be paid.
The property of Crassus, however, was not limited to the real estate men-
tioned above. Compare 1116 caleulations of Zumpt.

5. Imperiorum, honormn] military and eim'l offices.

6. Nulla . . . . requi est] This quotation is supposed by some to refel to

7. ,Declaravit id modo] Julius Caesar was assassinated in 1116 spring of
the year 111 which Cicero wrote this book.

Propter eum . . . . principatum] According 10 4, 6, there is implanted 111
man's moral nature an appetitio qacedam principatus. But Caesar had formed
a mistaken idea of this principatus, which led him 10 1116 violence alluded 10.

9. Perturbatz’one . . . . animi] passion. See Tusc. Disp. 4, 5. ‘⁴ Quae Graeci
πάθη vocant, nobis perturbationes appellari mayis placet quam morbos.”

Observe the corresponding ternis in the last sentences of the section:
‘repentino aliquo motu corresponds 10 perturbatione aliqua animi ; meditata
and proeparata, to consulto and eoqitata. B. Meditata, see Z. Gr. ἓ 632.

the second alterum substantively: in alterum incidunt, they fall into smne
