Harkness⁷s Caesar.

This edition of Caesur's Commentarios, intended to follow the Latin
Reader, aims to introduce the student to an appreciative study of Latin
authors. The text is the result of a careful collation of the several edi-
tions most approved by European scholars. The notes are intended to
gulde the faithful efforts of the learner, and to furnish him such collateral
information as will enable him to understand the stirring events recorded
in the Commentaries, and such special aid as will enable him to surmount
real difficulties of construction and idiom. They will thus, it is hoped,
render an acceptable service both to the instructor and the learner‚ by
lightening the burden of the one, and by promoting the progress of the
other. The dictionary has been prepared with special reference to the
wants of the student.

The Life of Caesar, the Map of Gaul, and the diagrams and illustra-
tions which accompany the notes, will greatly add to the value of the
work.

From Pres. Amm, Union Colleye„ N. Y. , From Prof. ΙΙ. W. ΙΙΛῩΝΕΒ, Universityqf

“This edition of the Commentaries is
admirably suited, not merely to give the
student an acquaintance with his immedi-
ate text-book, but also to develop those
habits of investigation, that thoughtfulness
in regard to the scope of the whole subject,
and that style of vigorous, tastefuh and
idiomatic rendering, Which are among the
rarest, as they are certainly among thc
most important, results of classical study.”
