14. I‘ruyum fructuumque] Usually when frugtes and fructus are dis·
tinguished, the former means the fruits of the field, the latter the fruits οί

species to genus. See Doed. IV, 334.

16. The words in italics form an iambic trimeter, but the verse is broken

5. Having shown that man is the chief source of good and in to man,
Cicero proceeds now to the connection of this fact with ethics. The obscu-
rity of the passage is somewhat removed by the following paraphrase of it
by Garve: If therefore this proposition is beyond a doubt—that nothing is
so useful and so harmful to men as man—it also seems to me to be estab-
lished, that it is virtue which makes the hearts of men our own, and inspires
them with the dispositions which our interests require. That utility then
which accrues to human life from inanimate objects and from the use and
management of animals, although it also comes to us tlirouyh. men, is yet
the work of only a class of them, to wit, common laborers and those en-
gaged in the mechanic arts. But the advantages which we can derive
from the good-will and attachment of men in general for the promotion oi
our happiness or our advancemcnt, these the great and wise man must
secure for himself by his virtues.

It will be perceived that the force of itaque (ἓ 6) falls on the second
part of the sentence, hominum autem studia . . . . virtute excitantur, the
things spoken of in the former part, being proper objects of purchase, or

the sense of ἓ 6 thus: AEdium constructio, lanificium, belluarum captura,
usus, cura, cetera, suae quidque arti tribuitur, hominum gratiae comparandae
ars non est propria quaedam praeter ipsam virtutem.
