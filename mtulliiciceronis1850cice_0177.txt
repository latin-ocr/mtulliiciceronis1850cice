1. Volumus quidem certe] By this parenthesis the author would avert
he suspicion of arrogance. He explains the preceding clause, claiming
only the desiyn to be thorough in this discussion. Comp. Z. Honorati]

opinions, the dogmas of philosophers are called placita. Comp. 2, 11.

3. Hanc Scauri . . . . cedibus] Scaurus used the material of the house of

 

 

Octavius for enlarging his own. Cicero makes mention of this AEmilius
