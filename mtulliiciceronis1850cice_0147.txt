man of violence, and the robber, do no wrong. On the other hand, the
Stoics, while they maintained that virtue alone was to be sought for its own
sake, nevertheless conceded that external things, although none of them
could be called a genuine good or a real evil, were yet valuable, and that
different external things differed in value‚ and might be preferred one to
another. Comp. Ritter's Hist. Ano. Philosophy, translated by Morrison,

Hoc quidem tempore] For Cicero, although an 00100110, was rather in-
clined to the philosophy of the N ew Aeademy than to that of the Stoies.

12. A ratione] Zumpt, personifying ratio, makes this the ablative of the
voluntary agent. Gernhard, 111ςο Zumpt, makes the clause equjx alent to
, quam ratio suscipit. Beier omits the preposition. Bonnell retains a with
its common signification, and translates: vom Wesen der Saehe ausgehend,
proeeeding from. Goerenz gives it the signification which it has in such
phrases as ab hae parte, a qua parte. It may be translated as follows:

4. Alia divisio] It will appear below that this division coineides essen-

The Stolos divide duties (τὰ καθήκοντα, officia) first into perfect, (τέλεια 01

Hoc autem commune officium vocant] Most editors insert κα Ξῆκον, after
officium. Heusinger and Zumpt reject it as wanting authority, and make
officium, the corresponding Latin word, its substitute. But tltz‘s common
(duty, i. e., that which men commonly mean when they speak of duty,)
they call (fficium. Heusinger, however, refers hoc to medium fficium above,
and connects commune with offi'cium in the predicate, the expression being
then equivalent to μέσον καθῆκον. The following remarks, translated and
