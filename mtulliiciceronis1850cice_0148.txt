here to aid those who are not familiar with the doctrines of the Stoica]
philosophy, in understanding the somewhat obscure sentences in this section.

The Stoic believes that nothing can be a good for man which does not
pcrtain to himself ; that he is therefore only concerned to know what his

nature is, and then to perfect it. All men indeed unconsciously make it
their ultimate aim to bring themselves nearer to perfection. But the wise
man, becoming conscious of this ultimate aim, leaves the indirect paths by
which the artificial motives and social prejudices and passions of men seek
for happiness, and shapes his course directly towards this goal.

Nothing, at the first glance, appears more absurd in the system of the
Stoics than this: that they, who consider virtue the only good, set down all
the duties of which Cicero treats in this book among things indifferent—-
things which, like riches and honor, are neither good nor bad—which deserve
some preference to be sure, but never further the true happiness of man.

But this system finds a parallel in the creed of theologians, who consider
sinful the virtues of the heathen, and account every performance of duty,
which does not spring from Christian motives, better indeed than the neg·
lect of the same, but insufficient to make man acceptable to his Maker or
blessed in himself. Now to the Clnistian of these theologians corresponds
the wise man of the Stoics. The virtues of the heathen and the unconverted
are their media officia—acts by which external good is secured and evil
avoided, but which nevertheless give no sign of true, internal, moral good-
ness. The virtues of the Christian, the acts of the completely reformed, or
rather, the completely developed—the altogether perfect inan—are the
officia perfecta.

The substance of this is, that man's acts hold a twofold relation3 one
to the heart and spirit of the man, from which they spring, the other to
the effects which they cause in the world. Perfection—the true good, lies
only in man, in his inner, spiritual nature, in his fancies,·his inclinations.
External acts therefore can be good or bad only in the first of the two rela-
tions mentioned above—they can share in perfection only so far as they
are the outbreaks of the soul’s excellence.

In the second relation, that is, in relation to the outward aims and con
sequences, each act can have only that degree of value or worthlessness
which the things themselves have, of which it is the cause. If I alleviato·
the pain of a sufferer‚ or relieve the want of a poor man, the act can be
estimated no higher than the health which I restore, or the want which Ι
have satisfied. But inasmuch as these things, according to the system of
the Stoics, are neither good nor evil, that act itself, estimated only in view
of its effects, can be called neither good nor evil. It has certainly a value,
because health and sustenance are valuable; but this value is only so great
that there arises a differ-enee between it and its opposite, in accord-anco
with which choice must be made, in case of a choice, but not so great tbm
it would be in itsclf a proper object of desire„
