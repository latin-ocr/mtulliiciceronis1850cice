tional nature transferring the likeness of this from the eyes to the mind
ἰ. e. transferring the idea of beauty, dxc„ from the objects of vision to tho
attributes of the soul. Oomp. B. and Garve.

conservandam] Z. Gr. ἓ 37 6.

9. Etiamsi nobilitatum non sit] This is aimed at the opinion of Epicu
ms: qui πεῖραι se intelligyere quid sit honestum, si id non estin voluptate,
nisiforte illud, quod multitudinis rumore laudatur. (Pin.
2, 15.) .

Honestum est] est has been preferred to sit in this edition. Zumpt re·
tains the sit of Heusinger, the construction being similar to that of the sub·
junctive in the apodosis in chapter 2, 6. Beier and Orelli prefer est.

A nullo] used substantively instead of nemine. Z. Gr. ἓ 67 6.

In this fourth chapter Cicero enters on the discussion of the honestum,
by making a cursory examination of the nature of man, designing thereby
to settle the basis of his Subsequent subdivision of the honestum into the
four cardinal virtues, viz„ justitia, (see ἓ 4,) sapientia, (see ξ 5,) maynitudo
animi, (ἓ 6,) temperantia, (ἓ ¹7 and ἓ 8.)

On. V. 1. Formam . . . . sapientiae] formam embodies‚ faciem personffies,
moral goodness. Doederlein, IV. 318. Cicero refers to this passage,
Phaedrus of Plato, (see 65‚) in the second book de Finibus c. 16, where he
translates it as follows: oculorum est in nobis sensus acerrimus, quibus sa-
pientiam non camimum quarn illa ardentes amores excitaret sui, si vide·
retur!

2. Rerum contractarum] fidelity in regyarcl to contracta Instead of res
contractce, contractus was afterwards used.

3. Quae prima descripta est] wli-ich was first set off (from the rest.) Sapi
entia and prudentia are the moral qualities which correspond to the per-
spicientia veri sollertiaque, while indayatz’o atque inventio veri are the cor-
responding moral (luties. B.

Velut ea· ea parte. . . . inest] By this anacoluthon Cicero avoids the repe-
tition of nascuntur, the last word of the preceding sentence.

Ejusque virtutis] scil. sapientiae et prmlmztioe, which are not distinguished
here as in Chap. 43.

4. Ut enirn quisque . . . . is] Another example of anacoluthon, occasioned
by the introduction of the relative clause: quique, etc. Otherwise sic or ito
would have followed to correspond with ut.

5. Huic] scil. virtuti.

Reliquis autem tribus virtutibus] scil. justitia, fortitudini, temperantioe.

Necessitates] the necessary external relations of life. B. Compare 44,
10. The field of the three remaining virtues is human needs, and laboring
here, it is their business to create and preserve those things in which prac-
tical life (life's action) is comprised. Thus justitia has to do with the es
