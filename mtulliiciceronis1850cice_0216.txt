Arnold's Classical Series has attained a circulation almos.) unparalleled, having been
introduced into nearly all the leading educational institutions in the United States.
The secret of this success is, that the author has hit upon the true system of teaching
the ancient languages. He exhibits them not as dead, but as living tongues; and by
imstation and repetition, the means which Nature herself points out to the child learn-
ing his mother-tongue‚ he familiarizes the student with the idioms employed by the
elegant writers and speakers of antiquity.

The First and Second Latin Book should be put into the hands of the beginners‚ who
will soon acquire from its pages a better idea os the language than could be gained by
months of study according to the old system. The reason of this is, that every thing
has a practical bearing, and a principle is no sooner learned than it is applied. The pupil
is at once set to work on exercises.

The Prose Composition forms an excellent sequel to the above work, οι· may be
used with any other course. It teaches the art of writing Latin more correetly and
thoroughly‚ more easily and pleasantly, than any other work. In its pages Latin syno-
nymes are caresully illustrated, differences of idioms noted, cautions as to common errors
impressed on the mind, and every help afforded toward attaining a pure and flowing
Latin style.

From N. Wnnnnmz, Principal os Worcester Cozmty Hiqh School.

“ In the skill with which he sets forth the idiomatae peculiaritiee, as well as in the
directness and symplicity with which he states the facts of the ancient languages, Mr.
Arnold has no superior. I know of no books so admirably adapted to awaken an inter-
e-st in the study of the language‚ or so well fitted to lay the foundation of a correct schol-

arship and refined taste.”

From A. B. RUSSELL, Oaldand fflqh school.

‘⁴ The style in which the books are got up are not their only recommendation. With
thorough instruction on the part of the teaeher using these books as text-books, I am
»uun fident a much more ample return for the time and labor bestowed by our youth upon
imin must be secured. The time certainly has come when an advance must be made
*pon the old methods of instruction. I am glad to have a work that promises so many
ι {vrtzimges as Arnold's Fir-st and Second Latin Book to beginners.”

From O. M. Bran, Classical Teaeher, Philadelplzia.

‘⁴ Ι am much pleased with Arnold's Latin Books. A class of my older boys have just
nnished the First and Second Book. They had studied Latinior along time before,
but never understood it, they say, as they do n0w.”
