9. Illagsisque de industria] Ir. Crassus and Philippus it was more a·
natural endowment, in Oaesar the result of study. Ooncerning this Oaesar.
whose cognomen was Strabo, see Cic. Brutus, cap. 48. Philippus is spoken
of in the same work, cap. 47, and Scaurus, cap. 29. M. Druso adoles·
cente] Probably M. Livius Drusus, who was an opponent of O. Gracchus.
In Cic. Brut. he is called i ir et oratione yravis et auctoritate. Iri qjus . . . .
tristior] This clause Garve freely translates thus: his friend Scipio, on
the other haud, was more occupied with the projects of his ambition, and
less interested in the pleasures of society.

11. Callidum Ilannibalem . . . . accepimus facile celare, etc.] accepimus
is the perfect definite, and is nevertheless connected with the present infini-
tive in a narrative of what is past. Z. Gr. ξ 589. Bonnell suggests,
although he does not prefer, another construction, which, after a Greek
analogy‚ makes the infinitives depend on callidum. Proeripere] is a
stronger expression than praecipere, which is the reading of some editions,
but rests on inferior authority.

12. In quo [feriere] In which department, to wit, of arts or accomph'sh·
ments. Vita ejus] Usage would require sua, for which the writer, as
if having forgotten, for the moment, that thc subordinate clause expressed

substituted ejus. Madvig (ἓ 481, note 3.) attributes this deviation from
regularity to a want of care. He asserts, however, that it never occurs in

leading verb. For instance, eum would never be found in the place of se,

the relative clause shows that the subjectos sunt is not indefinite in the
mind of Cicero. De insidiis] Heusinger says: De h. l. locale est. Jt

Comp. de transverso, de ter-90. Heusinger adds: solent optimi scriptores
variare praepositiones. Thus Liv. 42, 24. Ob nullam aliam causam nisi
