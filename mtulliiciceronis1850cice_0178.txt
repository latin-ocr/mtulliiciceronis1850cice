place. This science, (this knowing how,) to lo each thing at the right time
and in the proper place, is what the Greeks call εὐταξίαν. This word has
two meanings. The first, (in which I do not here u‘se it,) can be expressed
in Latin by the word modestia, and in German by the word Besclzetdenhem

our desires. The second corresponds with our word order, and this idea
is also sometimes included in t‘he word modestia. In this second meaning
it is thus defined by the Stoics, etc. (Garve’s Abhandl. p. 90..)
