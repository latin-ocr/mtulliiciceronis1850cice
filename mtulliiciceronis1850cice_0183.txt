mn. 11. OAP. 111. 167

7. Si . . . . aliquis] f‘ We are sometimes obliged, in English, to express
- he emphasis of aliquis by the word really? Z. Gr. ἓ 708.

8. Cokortamur] has a general signification3 fecimus refers to Cicero
only. Alio quodam libro] Comp. de Divin. II: cohortati sumus, ut
maxime potuimus, adphilosoploez'oe studium eo libro, qui est inscriptas Hor-
tensius.

10. Occurritur autem, etc] Having disposed of the objection urged by
the boni viri, Cicero now presents that of the docti et cruditi. The latter
involves a charge of inconsistency, because Cicero, while he held mainly to
the N ew Academy, which denied the certainty of all knowledge, was nev-
ertheless engaged in this discussion of the rules of duty and giving his
opinions on philosophical subjects with an appearance of certainty. Zumpt
distinguishes docti and eruditi thus: Docti sunt qui aliquam rem rite didi·
cerunt, hoc quidem loco, qui philosophiae operam dederunt, eruditi hoc am

plius qui etiam litteras norunt; sunt igitur Kenner und Gelehrte.
11. Vellem] Z. Gr. ἓ 528, 2.

 

14. Impediat . . . . sequi] See Z. Gr. ἓξ 543, 544.

15. Nostris] The disciples of the Academy. Causarum depends on
contentio. Esset violates the rules for the connection of tenses, and must
be accounted sor by the supposition that the writer makes a transition to a
historical account of the dogmas of the Academicians. Z.

17. Iis simillimo] Does Cicero here spe-ak of externa] resemblance!
See Z. Gr. ἓ 411.

 

 

Cn. III. See Conspectus.

l. Quinque . . . persequendis] See I, 3, end. Observe the force of igritur
and compare eryo in ἓ 8. Z. ¹

3. In quo] Orelli has restored verbo after quo. Zumpt however follows
the Heusfflgers, Beier, and others in rejecting it.

4. Summa quidem, etc] It is true that philosophers of the highest au
thority make a theoretical distinction between these three blended ideas oi
ν the honestum, the justum, and the utile, but in this they do nothing to vio-
late a truly strict morality.

5. Eae quo efficitur] it is made out, it follows.

6. Versutos et callidos] Cicero gives the following explanation of these
words in the de Nat. Deor. (III, 10): v e r s uto s eos appello, quorum cele-
riter mens versatur ; c allido s autem, quorum tanquam manus opere, sic
animus usu concalluit. B.

11. Pietas et sanctitas] The former refers to the heart, the latter to the
life. Ζ. Proxime et secundum] The difference between proximum and
seeundum, is illustrated in Horat. Carm. I, 12, 17-20.

13. Nec his, etc. ] “ In double relative sentences, Cicero not unfrequent*

ly abandons the relative construction in the second member and makes use
of the demonstrative.” Z. Gr. ἓ 806.
