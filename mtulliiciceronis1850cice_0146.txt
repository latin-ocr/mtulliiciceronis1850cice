Aristo of Chios, and Herillus of Carthage were Stoics; Pyrrho was the
founder of the sect os the Skeptics. They agreed in considering all exter-
nal things mdifferent——in deuying that they should be reckoned among
things good or evil. 1. Pyrrho taught this by denying all groimds of truth.
For, if in the case of our objects of thought there is never any reason for
considering them, or any one of them, true rather than false, then of 6011156
there is never any true ground sor asserting that any external object is
good, or a proper object of desire or preference. “Pyrrho is said to be the
originator os the doctrine that there is 110 diffcrence between hcalth and
siekness, life and death?

2. Aristo, like Herillus, deviated from Zeno, their common toacher and
1116 founder of their sect. He rejected all parts of philosophy except ethics.
and even limited the domuin of ethics itself, for he taught that its object

itis 1116 province of the philosopher to show wherein the supreme good
censis-ts. “ With Aristo, naught is of worth but virtue, nothing is evil but
vice. He sccks to refute the opinion that there is such a differeuce in ex-
terual things that one is preferable to another.'’

3. Herillus limits the virtue of the sage to seience and knowledge. He
considers practical life, which is occupied about external things, as simply
necessary, and denies it to be beautiful, on the ground that it does not
contribute aught to the supreme good.

This principle, common to these three philosophers, strikes at the root
of practical morality. For if lise 15 not preferable to death, health to sick-
