Cicero de Officiis :
With English Notos, mostly translated from ZUMrr and nomm. By
THOMAS A. THACHER, of Yale College. 12mo, 194 pageS.

In this edition, a few historical notes have been introduced in cases where the Dic-
tionary in common use has not been found to contain the desired informati0n; the design
of which is to aid the learner in understanding the contents of the treatises, the thoughts
and reasoning of the author, to explain grammatical difficulties and inculcate a knowl-
edge of grammatical principles. The Editor has aimed throughout to guide rather than
carry the learner through difficulties3 requiring of him more study, in consequence of
his help, than he would have devoted to the book without it.

“I have examined with much pleasure Prof. Thaeher's edition os Cicero de Officiis.
and am eonvinced of its excellence. The Notes have been prepared with great care and
good judgment. Practical knowledge of the wants of 1116 student has enabled the Editor
to furnish just the kind of assistance required3 grammatica} difficulties are removed.v and
the obscurities of the treatise are explained, the interest os the 161111161- 15 elicited, and his
industry directed rather than superseded. There can be but one opinion with regar-d to
the merita of the work, and Ι trust that Professor Thacher will be disposed to continuo
his labora 50 carefully commenccd, in this department of ekissical loarntngy’
