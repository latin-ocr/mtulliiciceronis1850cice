Oaesar's Commentaries on the Gallie lVar.
With English Notos, Critical and Explanatory3 a Lamon, Geographi-
cal and Histoi-'mal Indexes, a Map of Gaul, ete. By Rev. J. A.
SPENCER, D. D. 12m0, 408 pages.

In the preparation of this volume, great care has been taken to adapt it in every re·
spect to the wants of the young student, to make it a means at the same time os advan-
cing him in a thorough knowledge of Latin, and inspiring him with a desire for further
acquaintance with the classies of the language. Dr. Spencer has not, like some commen-
tators, given an abund-auce of help on the easy passages, and allowed the difficult one·
to speak for themselves. His Notes are on those parts on which the pupil wants them,
and explain, not only grammatical difficulties, but allusions of every kind in the text. A
well-drawn sketch of Caesar‘s life, a Map of the region in which his campaigns were ear-
ried on, and a Vocabulary, which removes the necessity of using a large dictionary and

the waste of time consequent thereon, enh-‘mee the value of the volume in no small de-

gree.

Quintus Curtius :

Life and Exploits of Alexander the Great. Edited and illustrated
with English Notos. By WILLIAM HENRY CROSBY. 12mo,

385 pagos

Curtius's History of Alexander the Great, though little used in the schools of this
country, in England and on the Continent holds a high place in the estimation of classi·
cal instructors. The interesting character of its subJect, the elegance of its style. and the
purity of its moral sentiments, ought to place it at least on a par with Caesar's Commen-
taries or Sallust's Histories. The present edition, by the late Professor of Latin in Rut-
gers College, is unexceptionable in typography, convenient in form, seholarly and prae‘
tical in its notes, and alLogether an admirable text-book for classes preparing for col·
lege.

From Pnor. mev, of the Neu> Yorlc Free Accedent y.

“It gives me great pleasure to add my testimonial to the many you are receiving: in
favor of the beautiful and well-edited edition of Quintus Curtius, by Prof. Wm. Henrv
Crosby. It is seldom that a classical book is submitted to me for examination, to which
Ι can give so hearty a recommendation as to this. The externa] appearance is atti-active:
the paper, type, and binding, being just what a text-book should be, neat, clear, and du-
rable. The notes are brief. pertinent, scholar-like, neither too exuberant nor too mee-gre,

igit happily exemplifying the golden mean no desit-able and yet so very difficult os at
