Virgil's AEneid.

With Explanatory Notes. By HENRY S. FRIEZE, Professor of
vLatin in the State University of Michigan. Illustrated. 12mo,
598 pages.

The appearance of this edition of Virgil's AEneid will, it is believed,
be hailed with delight by all classica] teacherS. Neither expense nor
pains have been spared to clothe the great Latin epie in a fitting dress.
The type is unusually large and distinet, and errors in the text, so an-
noying to the learner, have been earefully avoided. The work contains
eighty-five engravings, which delineate the usages, costumes, weapons,
arts, and mythology of the ancients with a vividness that ean be attained
only by pictorial illustrations. The great feature of this edition is the
scholar-ly and judicious commentary furnished in the appended Notes.
The author has here endeavored not to show his learning, but to supply
such practical aid as will enable the pupil to understand and appreciate
what he reads. The notes are just full enough, thoroughly explaining
the most difficult passages, while they are not so extended as to take all
labor off the pupil's hands. Properly used, they cannot fail to impart an
intelligent acquaintance with the syntax of the language. In a word, this
work is commended to teaehers as the most elegant, accurate, interesting,

and practically useful edition of the AEneid that has yet been published.

exceedingly pleased in my examination of it. The size of the type from which the text

The adherence to a standard text throughout, increases the value of this edition.”
