A Platone] See ninth letter ad Archytam. Solum] Z. Gr. ξ 687.

Ortusque] After a negative clause que, as well as et, has often an ad-
versative signification. Ortus calmot be construed strictly, yet it follows
nati suut naturally, and we may use a similar expression in English: we
have not been born for ourselves alone ; but our country claims an interest,

our friends an interest in (lit. a share of) our birth.
Quoniam . . . nati sumus . . . atque, ut placet Stoicis . . . creari] Observc

the anacoluthon. Instead of ereantur we have creari, which depends on placet.

Communes . . . . afferre] Compare 16, 8. The duties which Cicero finds
enjoined 'oy nature are twofold: (1.) to labor to render those things acces·
sible to all which are usesul to the public generally; (2) to aid in strength-

8, 9. 20, l—alz’qua for alia qua, for ira is a perturbatio animi. Zumpt (nd
Verr. V. 28, ’Ῑ 2) says, Nam aliquis saepissime est pro alius quis. ' Compare
objections to this explanation in Neue Jahrb„ Vol. 55, p. 171.

Is quasi . . . . videtur] quasi and videtur are introduced into the clause
because thc language is figurative and not strictly true. Comp. 4, 3.

by confining the discussion to avarice and ambition as examples of the whole.
