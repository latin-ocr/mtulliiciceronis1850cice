scanty. T he example of the German editors already named, and m·
deed of almost all German commentators, can, it is true, be· quoted fo-
a different course. But it eho-uld be borne in mind that they prepare
their works for-those who are not supplied with these books of refer·
ence. A German commentary is a transcript of the instructions of the
class· -room, where oral teaching takes the place of silent study, and, to
a great extent, supplies the want of manuals. Such a commentat-y
therefore contains all the explanations which its author has been ac-
customed to give to his class3 not only grammatica] and critical com-
ments, but those also which pertain to geography, history, biography,
and antiquities. It should be observed, however, that German pupils
do not, as a general rule, make use of such commentaries, but of the
unadorned text of the authors they study. In this edition, a few notes
of the historical class spoken of have been introduced, in cases where
the dictionaries in common use have not been found to contain the de-
s‘ired information.

The general design of the brief commentary is two-sold: first, to
aid the learner in understanding the contents of the treatise, the
thoughts and connections of thought of the author3 and second, to
explain grammatical difficulties, and especially to inculcate a know-
ledge of grammatical principles. The editor has aimed throughout to
guide rather than carry the learner through difficulties, requiring of
him more study in consequence of his help, than he would probably
have devoted to the book without it. There will be found frequent
references to the grammars where there is no difficulty in translating
and understanding the author, and that for the mere purpose of in-
forming or reminding the learner of some law of the language. To
some these references will undoubtedly seem too numerous. They
will seem to leave to the careful student too little opportunity to ex-
ercise his own ingenuity, to leave him no difficulties to solve himself.
There is much force in this obJ‘ection, and in the preparation of some
works for the use of learners it ought to prevail. But yet, considering
the attainments of the great body of students who would be likely to
read this book 3 would not more on the whole be gained by a multipli- ·
cation of references than by their omission? Besides, numerous as
they are, they do not comprise all that are inserted by Zumpt himself
in his edition, not a few having been omitted, as unnecessarily directing
the attention of the learner to principles, with which, it might be taken
for granted, that he was already sufficiently familiar. On this-point,
therefore, the error, if there is one, is probably on the side of scantiness.

The notes are not all referred to their sources. Of those which are
