180 NOTES

4. Eum-norum] Similarity of construction would have required externe
inter se hoc modo comparantur. But for the sake of brevity the construc-
tionis changed, Heusinger makes externorum depend on numero under-
stood, (e numero.) According to Bonnell it depeuds on ylorz'a and vectiya-
lia. For a construction like the latter, compare Tac. Germ. 9: Deorum
maaeime Mercurium colunt ; Tac. Hist. Ι, 31: Tribunorum Subrium et O(-
rium milites adorti ; Hist. ΙΙ, 15: quorum improvide secutos equites cir-
cmnvenerunt. Vectigalia] This word here means, private ·income;
vectiyalia urbana, income from possessione in tlte city.

5. Pascere] The raisiny of cattle. Quid fenerari ..... occide-re]
Compare what Cicero says of usurers‚ I, 42, 2.

7. optimis viris] This expression is evidently ironicaL

 

 

Ad Janum

 

medium] J anus summus, Janus medius, and Janus imus are mentioned
by Latin Writers. Beier holds that the two sides of the Forum Romanum,
along which were ranged the tabernoe, shopS‚ and places of business, were
called J anus medius3 while the end nearest the Capitol was called J anus
summus; and the remote end, J anus imus. Zumpt, on the other hand,
maintains that they were three over-built passages to the forum, where
the usura-s and gold and silver smiths had the'n· places of business.
